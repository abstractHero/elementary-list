# What is this?
This is simple todo list, which use RecyclerView. The application consists of three tabs. At startup, an average tab opens, in which you can add new tasks. When you click on the CheckBox, the task moves into a tab named "Finished". The third tab "Special" contains special tasks that come here when you click on the shine button(star).

P.S. This is my first Android application
